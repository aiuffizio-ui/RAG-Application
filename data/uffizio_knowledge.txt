Overview of Reseller

================================================================================

Title: User Hierarchy
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/getting-started

User Hierarchy
When using the platform, we must first understand the user hierarchy, which involves knowing the various levels of access and permissions that are given to various individuals within the system.
The basic principle of user hierarchy is that a subordinate account cannot have more rights than a parent one. It is important to organize the hierarchy before getting started in software.
A step-by-step guide to get you started is provided below:
Understanding User Roles on the Platform
In order to manage and operate the platform effectively, it is important to understand the different user roles and their respective access levels. The platform follows a clearly defined hierarchy to ensure security and organization across various types of users and entities.
Primary Users
These are the top-level users who have the highest level of control and access to the platform.
Admin:
Manages the platform, including user creation, roles, and permissions.
Reseller:
Purchases the software from the Admin and resells it to clients with custom branding and pricing.
Company:
Uses the software to manage assets, fleets, or workforce.
Secondary Users
These users are created by Primary Users to assist with specific tasks and operations.
Subusers:
Created by Admins, Resellers, or Companies to help manage accounts, tasks, and data. Subusers have limited permissions, based on their roles.
Tracking Entities
These represent the physical assets and individuals that are tracked within the platform.
Object:
Any physical item (vehicles, machinery, inventory) tracked by the platform.
Driver:
Individuals operating vehicles or equipment, whose activities are monitored to ensure safety and efficiency.
Account Types:
There are 3 account types in the application:
Note:
These user roles are considered a Primary User, meaning they have full access and management capabilities over their respective accounts and operations.
Admin
Reseller
Company
Admin
An Admin on the platform is a user with full access and management of the platform. Platform settings, configurations, and user accounts must be managed by the administrator. The admin has the ability to manage the platform data, provide roles and permissions, and create new users.
We will create and provide the user with access to their manager accounts.
The administrator account can be modified by authorized personnel within the organization who hold the necessary responsibilities and permissions. It is their duty to ensure the platform functions effectively and meets operational expectations.
Reseller
A distributor known as a Reseller will buy the software from the admin and then resell it to its clients.
The admin creates reseller accounts in the software as per requirements.
Resellers have the capability to personalize and brand the software by incorporating their own logo, as well as establishing customized tariff plans. To provide their clients with a comprehensive solution, resellers can either offer the software as an independent product or seamlessly integrate it with their existing services.
Company
In the software, a Company refers to an organization or business that uses the software to manage their assets, fleet, or workforce. A company can be any type of business or organization, such as a transportation company, construction company, manufacturing company, or any other industry that requires asset tracking or workforce management.
We additionally have the subusers for each user mentioned above, where the users will have the access to create the subusers and assign them permission, roles, and responsibilities.
Subusers
are considered Secondary Users with limited permissions as granted by their Primary User (Admin, Reseller, or Company). Subusers assist in specific operations based on their assigned roles.
Admin Subuser
In the software, a subuser can be created by an administrator to create a new user with custom privileges and permissions.
Subusers' rights are limited to their roles and responsibilities. This makes it possible to manage the administrator account more efficiently and ensures that only authorized users can access confidential data.
Please Note:
Using the credentials provided to you by us, you can log in to the administrator account.
After logging into the admin account, you can
Edit the Admin account
details and
Configure the account for the Admin Subuser
.
Reseller Subuser
A Reseller subuser in software is a user account made by the reseller for their employees. The subuser account is linked to the reseller's account and is designed to provide the reseller's employees with the necessary access to the software.
The reseller can manage the subuser's invoicing and account information as well as the degree of access the subuser has to the software.
Please Note:
Admin will
Create a reseller
account, and then the Resellers can log in to their account. A
Reseller subuser
can be created once the Reseller account is created.
Company Subuser
Within the software, a Company can create multiple users and assign them different roles and permissions, allowing them to access and manage different aspects of the company's operations which is known as a Company subuser.
Please Note:
An Admin or Reseller is responsible to
creating a Company
, after which any of these users—Admin, Reseller, or Company—can establish a
Company subuser
tailored to the specific needs of that company.
Branch
In the software, a Branch refers to a location or a physical site of a Company. For example, if a Company has multiple offices or warehouses in different locations, each of these locations can be considered a branch in the software.
Users using the software can set up and manage multiple branches inside a single Company account, which is useful for businesses with a functional organizational structure or those who perform business in various regions.
Please Note:
You can
add a new Branch
. If a Company doesn’t have any Branch, then a Branch will be created by default by the Company’s name.
The following are considered
Tracking Entities
, which are managed and monitored by Primary and Secondary Users to ensure efficient operations and asset management.
Object
An Object in the software is any physical object or asset that is being tracked and supervised by the software. In the software, examples of objects include vehicles, goods, machinery, and other inventory items. Each object in the software has a special identifier that allows it to be traced from the time it is added in the software until it is deleted.
The system allows users to view real-time information about the location, status, and history of each object, making it easier to manage inventory and assets efficiently.
Please Note:
You can
Add objects
either manually or do a bulk upload.
Driver
In the software, a Driver is someone who operates a vehicle or piece of equipment that is being tracked and managed on the platform.
Drivers can be assigned to specific vehicles or equipment, and their activities can be monitored to ensure safety and efficiency.
Please Note:
You can
Upload driver records
either manually or do a bulk upload.
Driver is included only in the Standard and Premium versions of the platform.
Download the
Driver
app:
Android:
Get it on Google Play
iOS:
Download on the App Store
Please Note:
The Driver app is exclusively available as part of the Premium Version.

Title: Billing Module
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/billing-module

Billing Module
The Billing Module streamlines vehicle licensing and renewal processes by allowing users to track license expiry dates, set up reminders, and facilitate timely renewals. It ensures all vehicles remain compliant, enabling clients to easily manage payments and maintain operational continuity.
Benefits of the Billing Module
Create Tariff Plan:
Design specific plans for vehicle licensing and renewal based on requirements, such as vehicle type, duration, or service level.
Online Payment
: Enable clients to keep track of upcoming vehicle expiration and renew their licenses conveniently through a secure online payment system.
Recurring Billing
: Automate recurring billing cycles for service renewals to ensure timely payments and uninterrupted services.
Invoice Management
: Generate and manage invoices for all the payment and renewal services, ensuring clear and accurate records.
Billing Reports
: Track payment status and history for pending and completed transactions, generating detailed billing reports for transparency and efficient record-keeping.
Types of License
Depending on the
License Type
set in the Admin account (either
Tariff or Non-Tariff
) by the administrator, the Admin can assign rights and define Tariff plans for both Reseller and Company accounts. Resellers, on the other hand, are authorized to configure Tariff plans specifically for Company accounts.
Tariff
:
This option is advantageous when the license must be allocated to an individual vehicle, as it simplifies the management of each vehicle's licensing and renewal processes separately.
Non-Tariff
: This option is beneficial when licenses need to be set up at the user level, enabling users to efficiently manage licenses for multiple vehicles under a single account.
Please Note:
Users must choose either the Tariff or Non-Tariff option for their licensing needs, since both options cannot be utilized at the same time.

Title: Create Tariff Plan
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/create-tariff-plan

Create Tariff Plan
A Tariff Plan is used to define the pricing structure for vehicle licensing or subscriptions. It allows you to set specific rates based on vehicle usage, service types, or subscription duration.
The Tariff Plan consists of two distinct types:
Prepaid
and
Postpaid.
Prepaid
In a Prepaid plan, the user is required to make a payment first upfront before gaining access to the platform.
These plans can be structured with tiers for Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, and Yearly options, tailored to align with various platform versions (Lite, Standard, and Premium), allowing for appropriate price configuration.
For existing vehicles that already have plans, users have the option to upload an Excel file containing the expiry date details. These vehicles will expire on the specified dates and can be recharged accordingly.
When a new vehicle is added, the corresponding tariff plan will automatically be applied to that vehicle.
The user will receive a notification at the specified email address a few days prior to the expiration date, based on the number of days selected.
Free days may also be offered according to user preferences.
Please Note:
If the vehicle is not recharged prior to its expiration, the tracking functionality for that vehicle will be deactivated for the user.
Watch :
How to create prepaid tariff plan.
Postpaid
In a Postpaid plan, the user is granted access to the platform initially and is then billed for the services utilized.
The pricing for the postpaid plan should be defined on a per-day basis.
Please Note:
The duration of a Postpaid plan is fixed, i.e., for 30 days. After 30 days, the account expires. To reactivate the account, the user must complete the payment process.
Taxes may be applied to the plans as either a percentage or a fixed amount, depending on the specific requirements and applicable regulations.
For example, in India, 18% GST is applicable, so that can be added in the Tax section.
Additionally, users have the option to incorporate Payment Gateway Charges. This feature becomes applicable if Payment Gateways have been configured within the user's account settings. These charges may be applied as either a percentage or a fixed amount and can be structured as either a flat rate or based on specific slabs.

What is Video Telematics?
Video telematics represents a powerful fusion of video technology and telematics solutions. It includes features such as GPS tracking, vehicle diagnostics, and fleet management functionalities. This integration enhances fleet monitoring, safety, and overall efficiency.
How Video Telematics Works?
Video telematics involves the installation of cameras or video recording devices in vehicles. These devices capture real-time footage, including Driver Monitoring System (DMS) and Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) views of the vehicle. This video data is then combined with other telematics data, including location, speed, and various vehicle performance metrics.
The Purpose of Video Telematics.
The primary objective of video telematics is to empower fleet managers with valuable insights into driver behaviour, road conditions, and potential incidents. This technology plays an important role in:
Monitoring driver performance.
Identifying risky driving behaviours (e.g., distracted driving, speeding, harsh braking).
Investigating accidents or incidents.
Providing constructive feedback to drivers.
This footage can be accessed and analyzed in real-time or saved for later review, offering flexibility and convenience.

Title: Why am I getting duplicate IMEI number while adding object ?
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/why-am-i-getting-duplicate-imei-number-while-adding-object

Why am I getting duplicate IMEI number while adding object ?
Each device should have a unique IMEI number to differentiate it from others. If you are encountering duplicate IMEI numbers while adding an object, there could be a few possibility that same device is added on the server.
Data Entry Error
It's possible that there was a data entry error during the process of adding the object. Double-check the IMEI number you are entering to ensure that it is accurate and doesn't contain any typos or mistakes. Even a small error can result in a duplicate IMEI.
To Verify
Login to your
account
Go to
Setting > General > Object
Search for the
IMEI
number which is giving the error.
If same
IMEI
is already added you will be able to see it.
Same device is used with different partner
To cut costs, vendors and end users could both utilise the same equipment. Duplicate IMEI errors may occur if the end user is utilising software that was purchased from a different vendor while using the same server.
Vendor needs to confirm with the end user from where did they purchased the device and also ask the user to delete the IMEI number from old service provider.
Please Note:
We would not be providing details for the vendor with whom the services were running earlier.
System Error
There might be a system error or bug in the software or platform you are using to add the object. In some cases, the system might not properly validate the uniqueness of IMEI numbers, resulting in duplicates. If this is the case, you should reach out to the technical support.
If all the above steps are done and you are still facing the issue, kindly raise a ticket for support.

Title: Google Map
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/google-map

Google Map
Overview
Google Maps plays a critical role in Uffizio’s telematics solutions by providing accurate, real-time location data and advanced mapping capabilities. With Google Maps integrated as a third-party service, Uffizio applications—such as Trakzee, SmartBus, and Smart Waste—can visualize vehicles, optimize routes, set geofences, and monitor fleet activities efficiently. This knowledge base explains the purpose, benefits, and implementation of Google Maps within Uffizio services, helping internal teams, clients, and support staff understand how mapping enhances telematics operations.
Introduction to Google Maps
Google Maps
is a widely used mapping platform that provides detailed geographic information, real-time traffic updates, and location-based services. As a
third-party service in Uffizio applications
, Google Maps enables:
Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:
Visualize fleet locations instantly.
Routing & Navigation:
Plan efficient routes considering distance and traffic.
Geofencing:
Create virtual boundaries and receive alerts when vehicles enter or exit specific areas.
Traffic Insights:
Access live traffic data for better route decisions.
Map Visualization:
Display vehicles, trips, stops, and operational points clearly on a map.
In Uffizio, Google Maps serves as the foundation for telematics visualization, while Uffizio adds fleet management, analytics, and operational control capabilities on top of it.
Google Maps Integration Steps
Integrating Google Maps into Uffizio applications involves enabling the required APIs, creating an API key, and configuring billing. The steps below guide internal teams or clients through the process.
Step 1: Create or Log in to Google Cloud Account
Visit
Google Cloud Console
.
Sign in with a Google account.
If you don’t have an account, create one and complete the necessary setup.
Step 2: Create a New Project
Click on the
project dropdown
at the top-left corner.
Click
New Project
.
Enter a
Project Name
(e.g., “Uffizio Telematics”).
Select an
Organization
(if required).
Click
Create
Step 3: Enable Required Google Maps APIs
Go to
APIs & Services > Library
in your project.
Go to Maps under API library
Enable the following APIs based on usage:
Maps JavaScript API
– for embedding interactive maps.
Note
: You can enable the API based on your requirement.
Click
Enable
for each selected API.
Step 4: Set Up Billing
Google Maps Platform requires billing to use APIs.
Go to
Billing > Add Billing Account
.
Enter your payment details.
Link the billing account to your project.
Note: Google provides a free tier monthly credit which can cover small-scale usage.
Step 5: Create an API Key
Navigate to
APIs & Services > Credentials
.
Click
+ Create Credentials → API Key
.
Google will generate a new API key.
Step 6: Restrict the API Key
(Highly Recommended)
Click
Edit API Key
.
Under
Application Restrictions
, choose one:
HTTP referrers
(for web apps)
IP addresses
(for server apps)
Under
API Restrictions
, select the APIs you enabled for this key
Click
Save
.
Step 7:Use Quotas to Limit API Usage
Go to
APIs & Services → Dashboard.
Select your specific API (e.g., Maps JavaScript API).
Click
Quotas
Set
daily or per-minute limits
for requests (e.g., 10,000 requests/day).
Save your configuration.
Note:
When the quota is reached, the API stops serving requests — preventing additional charges.
Step 8: Set Up Budget Alerts
Go to
Google Cloud Console → Billing → Budgets & Alerts.
Click
Create Budget.
Set a
budget amount
(e.g., ₹2,000 or $25).
Configure
alert thresholds
(e.g., 50%, 90%, and 100%).
Google will notify you via email when usage approaches or exceeds your budget.
Note:Use this to stay aware before crossing your preferred monthly spending limit.
Conclusion
Integrating Google Maps into Uffizio’s telematics solutions enhances accuracy, efficiency, and visibility across all applications. From real-time vehicle tracking to route optimization and geofencing, Google Maps acts as the foundation for all location-based services.
To maintain smooth and secure operations, always:
Enable only the APIs you need.
Apply access restrictions for every API key.
Set budgets, quotas, and alerts to control billing.
Monitor usage regularly through the Google Cloud Console.
With the right configuration, Google Maps not only improves functionality but also keeps operational costs predictable and manageable

Title: Add Expense
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/smartbus/add-expense

Add Expense
Expenses refer to the costs that incur while managing and maintaining assets or objects in the fleet. These expenses can include fuel costs, maintenance costs, insurance costs, taxes, etc.
Expenses are categorised in two types - Variable or Fixed.
Variable expenses are expenses that do not occur at a fixed time, and are sudden and unexpected. Expenses of accident, fuel, fines, toll taxes, etc. are the expenses that can occur at any time, which makes them variable expenses.
Fixed expenses are expenses that are expected to occur at a specific time. Expenses of insurance, taxes, driver, etc. are the expenses that occur at a specific time, which makes them fixed expenses.
The software offers dedicated reports and charts for expenses that helps the user to analyse and make informed decisions for the fleet.
Users can upload expense records one by one or in bulk.

Title: Geographical Structure
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/swm/geographical-structure

Geographical Structure
The
Smart Waste Management System
is designed to manage waste collection efficiently by mapping the entire service area into a structured geographical hierarchy. This ensures smooth monitoring, optimized routing, and effective waste collection across different regions.
Watch: Geographical Structure
Hierarchical Structure
Town
A
Town
serves as the primary and highest-level geographical unit within the Smart Waste Management System. It represents the overall operational boundary where the waste collection and monitoring activities are managed.
The Town acts as a
central administrative area
, bringing together all subordinate divisions such as Zones, Wards, and Collection Addresses under one unified framework. It helps in consolidating reports, resource allocation, and performance tracking for the entire region.
Each
Town
may include several
Zones
, each responsible for managing smaller administrative or geographical sections within it.
Zone
A
Zone
is a secondary geographical division within a Town that helps organize waste management operations into smaller, manageable areas. By dividing a Town into multiple Zones, the system ensures smoother coordination, localized supervision, and efficient waste collection scheduling.
Each Zone functions as a
regional operational hub
, allowing for targeted monitoring and resource deployment. Supervisors or zone managers can track collection activities, vehicle performance, and staff productivity specific to their designated Zone.
Zones are often created based on
geographical layout, population density, or service demand
, ensuring optimized routing and balanced workload distribution among collection teams.
Each
Zone
is further divided into multiple
Wards
, enabling micro-level management and accurate reporting within the waste management system.
Ward
A
Ward
is the smallest administrative and operational unit within a Zone in the Smart Waste Management System. It allows for
micro-level management
of waste collection activities and ensures that every locality within a Zone is systematically covered.
Each Ward represents a defined geographical area—such as a neighborhood, residential block, or local community—where waste collection, monitoring, and reporting are carried out. By breaking Zones into Wards, authorities can
track collection efficiency, identify service gaps, and respond quickly to on-ground issues
.
Ward-level mapping helps optimize
collection routes, manpower allocation, and vehicle scheduling
, providing better service coverage and accountability.
Each
Ward
contains multiple
Collection Addresses
, representing individual waste collection points such as homes, businesses, or public institutions.
Collection Address
A
Collection Address
is the most granular level in the Smart Waste Management System’s geographical hierarchy. It represents a specific
location or point
where waste is collected — whether it’s a residential home, commercial establishment, public institution, or industrial site.
Each Collection Address provides
precise location details
, ensuring that collection vehicles and staff can efficiently plan their routes and avoid missed pickups. It also enables
real-time tracking
of collection status, helping supervisors monitor daily operations with accuracy.
Collection Addresses play a vital role in maintaining accountability and service transparency, as each pickup can be logged, verified, and analyzed for performance insights.
Every
Collection Address
is mapped under its respective
Ward
, forming the foundation of the waste collection network within the system.
Additional Mapped Areas
Parking
and
Dump Yards
form the essential infrastructure for waste management operations. Parking Areas serve as designated spots for vehicles to be stationed before or after their collection routes, aiding in efficient route planning, vehicle allocation, and idle time monitoring.
Dump Yards
, on the other hand, act as the authorized disposal or processing sites where waste collected from various Wards within a Town or Zone is finally unloaded. Together, they ensure smooth logistical flow from collection to disposal, optimizing overall operational efficiency.

================================================================================

Title: User Hierarchy
URL: https://helpdesk.uffizio.com/knowledge/swm/user-hierarchy

User Hierarchy
When using the platform, we must first understand the user hierarchy, which involves knowing the various levels of access and permissions that are given to various individuals within the system.
The basic principle of user hierarchy is that a subordinate account cannot have more rights than a parent one. It is important to organize the hierarchy before getting started in software.
Watch
: User Hierarchy
A step-by-step guide to get you started is provided below:
Understanding User Roles on the Platform
In order to manage and operate the platform effectively, it is important to understand the different user roles and their respective access levels. The platform follows a clearly defined hierarchy to ensure security and organization across various types of users and entities.
Primary Users
These are the top-level users who have the highest level of control and access to the platform.
Admin:
Manages the platform, including user creation, roles, and permissions.
Reseller:
Purchases the software from the Admin and resells it to clients with custom branding and pricing.
Company:
Uses the software to manage assets, fleets, or workforce.
Secondary Users
These users are created by Primary Users to assist with specific tasks and operations.
Subusers:
Created by Admins, Resellers, or Companies to help manage accounts, tasks, and data. Subusers have limited permissions, based on their roles.
Tracking Entities
These represent the physical assets and individuals that are tracked within the platform.
Object:
Any physical item (vehicles, machinery, inventory) tracked by the platform.
Driver:
Individuals operating vehicles or equipment, whose activities are monitored to ensure safety and efficiency.
Account Types:
There are 3 account types in the application:
Note:
These user roles are considered a Primary User, meaning they have full access and management capabilities over their respective accounts and operations.
Admin
Reseller
Company
Admin
An Admin on the platform is a user with full access and management of the platform. Platform settings, configurations, and user accounts must be managed by the administrator. The admin has the ability to manage the platform data, provide roles and permissions, and create new users.
We will create and provide the user with access to their manager accounts.
The administrator account can be modified by authorized personnel within the organization who hold the necessary responsibilities and permissions. It is their duty to ensure the platform functions effectively and meets operational expectations.
Reseller
A distributor known as a Reseller will buy the software from the admin and then resell it to its clients.
The admin creates reseller accounts in the software as per requirements.
Resellers have the capability to personalize and brand the software by incorporating their own logo, as well as establishing customized tariff plans. To provide their clients with a comprehensive solution, resellers can either offer the software as an independent product or seamlessly integrate it with their existing services.
Company
In the software, a Company refers to an organization or business that uses the software to manage their assets, fleet, or workforce. A company can be any type of business or organization, such as a transportation company, construction company, manufacturing company, or any other industry that requires asset tracking or workforce management.
We additionally have the subusers for each user mentioned above, where the users will have the access to create the subusers and assign them permission, roles, and responsibilities.
Subusers
are considered Secondary Users with limited permissions as granted by their Primary User (Admin, Reseller, or Company). Subusers assist in specific operations based on their assigned roles.
Admin Subuser
In the software, a subuser can be created by an administrator to create a new user with custom privileges and permissions.
Subusers' rights are limited to their roles and responsibilities. This makes it possible to manage the administrator account more efficiently and ensures that only authorized users can access confidential data.
Please Note:
Using the credentials provided to you by us, you can log in to the administrator account.
After logging into the admin account, you can
Edit the Admin account
details and
Configure the account for the Admin Subuser
.
Reseller Subuser
A Reseller subuser in software is a user account made by the reseller for their employees. The subuser account is linked to the reseller's account and is designed to provide the reseller's employees with the necessary access to the software.
The reseller can manage the subuser's invoicing and account information as well as the degree of access the subuser has to the software.
Please Note:
Admin will
Create a reseller
account, and then the Resellers can log in to their account. A
Reseller subuser
can be created once the Reseller account is created.
Company Subuser
Within the software, a Company can create multiple users and assign them different roles and permissions, allowing them to access and manage different aspects of the company's operations which is known as a Company subuser.
Please Note:
An Admin or Reseller is responsible to
creating a Company
, after which any of these users—Admin, Reseller, or Company—can establish a
Company subuser
tailored to the specific needs of that company.
Branch
In the software, a Branch refers to a location or a physical site of a Company. For example, if a Company has multiple offices or warehouses in different locations, each of these locations can be considered a branch in the software.
Users using the software can set up and manage multiple branches inside a single Company account, which is useful for businesses with a functional organizational structure or those who perform business in various regions.
Please Note:
You can
add a new Branch
. If a Company doesn’t have any Branch, then a Branch will be created by default by the Company’s name.
The following are considered
Tracking Entities
, which are managed and monitored by Primary and Secondary Users to ensure efficient operations and asset management.
Object
An Object in the software is any physical object or asset that is being tracked and supervised by the software. In the software, examples of objects include vehicles, goods, machinery, and other inventory items. Each object in the software has a special identifier that allows it to be traced from the time it is added in the software until it is deleted.
The system allows users to view real-time information about the location, status, and history of each object, making it easier to manage inventory and assets efficiently.
Please Note:
You can
Add objects
either manually or do a bulk upload.
Driver
In the software, a Driver is someone who operates a vehicle or piece of equipment that is being tracked and managed on the platform.
Drivers can be assigned to specific vehicles or equipment, and their activities can be monitored to ensure safety and efficiency.
